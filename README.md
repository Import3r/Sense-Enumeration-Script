# Sense-Enumeration-Script
'Sense' is a simple bash script wrapper that utilizes 'nmap' along 'gobuster' for automated, initial scanning of a given target.

The tool was created to handle repetetive tasks that testers conduct when initially enumerating. currently it handles the most basic tasks of what I personally use, and I'm looking to expand its functionality in the future.

Hope you find it useful! all feedback of any sort is appreciated!
